//! The app's own defaults over the component library's controls.
//!
//! ## The pointer is the only thing that says "this does something"
//!
//! gpui-component draws every button variant except `link` and `text` with the
//! **arrow** cursor (`button.rs`: `cursor_default()`, then `cursor_pointer()`
//! only for those two). That is the platform convention this app is not
//! following: a session row, a completion candidate, a selector chip, an ask
//! choice and a fold strip are all hand-made `div`s that show a pointer,
//! because that is the one feedback a control gets *before* it is pressed.
//! Half the actions answering the pointer and half not is worse than either
//! rule applied whole — the cursor stops meaning anything, and the only way
//! left to find out whether something is clickable is to click it.
//!
//! So actions go through [`action`]. One place decides it, a guard keeps it
//! that way, and the library's own default is overridden exactly once rather
//! than at forty call sites that each have to remember.
